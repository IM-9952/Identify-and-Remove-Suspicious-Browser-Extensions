# Step 3: Evaluated Each Extension:

Verified developer authenticity and reviews from Chrome Web Store.

Noted down extensions asking for high-risk permissions like:

“Read and change all your data on websites”

“Access browser tabs and browsing activity”

# Step 4 :  Installed Extensions:

Google Docs Offline

Purpose: Allows offline access to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

Permissions: Minimal, limited to document access.

Status: Safe (developed by Google, no unusual permissions).

Microsoft Bing Search for Chrome

Purpose: Sets Microsoft Bing as the default search provider.

Permissions: Changes default search settings.

Status:  Safe, though it modifies search preferences.

# Step 5: Action Taken:

No suspicious or third-party extensions detected.

No action required as both extensions are trusted and widely used.

# Step 6:  Recommendations:

Regularly review installed extensions.

Only install extensions from trusted sources (e.g., Chrome Web Store).

Avoid granting unnecessary permissions (especially full access to all websites).

Enable Chrome’s "Enhanced Protection" under Security settings for safer browsing.
